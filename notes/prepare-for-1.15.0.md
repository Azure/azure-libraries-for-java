V1.15 is backwards compatible with V1.14 in the APIs intended for public use that reached the general availability (stable) stage in V1.x with a few exceptions in the ==XXXX== management library (though these changes will have minimal impact on the developer). 

Some breaking changes were introduced in APIs that were still in Beta in V1.14, as indicated by the `@Beta` annotation.


## Breaking changes

The following methods and/or types have been changed in V1.15 compared to the previous release (V1.14):
